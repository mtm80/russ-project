        <p>
            The Russian 2018 presidential elections are a being held at an opportune time for this project.  The election itself is slated for the 18th of March which is well within the timeline of our project.  Of course, due to the limitations of the course and available manpower, only a few candidates can be analyzed.  Among those that were chosen are Vladimir Putin, Pavel Grudinin, and Vladimir Zhirinovskii. 
        </p>
        <p>The particular texts were selected on the basis of availability rather than the nature of their content. The quantity of transcribed texts from interviews and speeches is actually rather limited, and since the focus of our work was on honing our skills as digital humanists, we decided not to manually transcribe. Regardless, we intend to draw whatever conclusions that we can from our corpus in the pursuit of our analysis. We plan to investigate recurring topics in their discourse and how their terminology reflects party ideology, popular attitudes, and how candidates relate to their audiences. We are using topic modelling to track the subjects that the candidates most frequently cite throughout their discourse.
        </p>
        <p>We chose the three candidates primarily because these three were among the earliest to register as candidates and also that, by our estimation, they were the leading candidates of the time. They all finished in the top three. For those who may not be familiar with these individuals, see the brief bios below.</p>
