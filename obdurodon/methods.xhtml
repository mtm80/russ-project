        <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>To build our analysis, we are applying an assortment of rhetorical tags to the discourse files of the candidates.  These tags account for the rhetorical techniques that the candidates use during their interviews and and speeches.  Taking into account the topics that the candidates address, these rhetorical techniques shed light on how the candidates appeal to their respective voter base and attempt to attract those who might not normally favor their party.  Where foreign countries are concerned, we can learn how particular parties profess to approach foreign relations.  This is of particular interest given the tense relationship that Russian currently has with the United States and many European countries.</p>
            
            <p>The following is a list of the specific tags that we are tracking.</p>

                <h2>Rhetorical devices</h2>
                <p>To best understand how each politician talks to the general public, we decided to
                    develop a system for annotating rhetorical tags, adapted from Rashidi and
                    Souzandehfar's work on discourse analysis. We settled on a set of 16 tags to help 
                    us profile the candidates' rhetorical style.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="device-name">Actor Description</span>
                        <span class="device-tag"> (&lt;ru:actorDesc&gt;) : </span>The &lt;evidence&gt; tag marks when the speaker describes an individual or group. We marked whether the sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral.</li>

                        <span class="device-name">Anecdote</span>

            <p>Several techniques such as "actor description", "consensus", "national self glorification", "polarization", and "victimization" are examples
                of manipulative tactics to rally support and create an "us" versus "them" scenario.  Techniques such as "anecdote", "evidentiality", 
                "number game", and "conclusion" are examples of a concrete and quantitative attempt to gain support.  Other techniques such as "authority", 
                "hyperbole", "irony", and "vagueness" indicate an abstract approach towards gathering support.</p>  
            
            <p>The occurence of these tactics throughout their discourse indicates the types of strategies that Russian politicians employ to gain favor
                among their fellow party members and voters.  The results of the election may shed light on which of these tactics yields the greatest 
                success.</p>
