To build our analysis, we are applying an assortment of rhetorical tags to the discourse files of the candidates.  These tags account for the rhetorical techniques that the candidates use during their interviews and and speeches.  Taking into account the topics that the candidates address, these rhetorical techniques shed light on how the candidates appeal to their respective voter base and attempt to attract those who might not normally favor their party.  Where foreign countries are concerned, we can learn how particular parties profess to approach foreign relations.  This is of particular interest given the tense relationship that Russian currently has with the United States and many European countries.

The following is a list of the specific tags that we are tracking.

"Actor Description" tag marks when the speaker describes an individual or group. We marked whether the sentiment was positive, negative, or neutral.
      
"Anecdote" tag marks when the speaker uses a story as part of their argument.
      
"Assumption" tag marks when the speaker explicitly makes an assumption in their argument.
    
"Authority" tag marks when the speaker references an authority. We also annotated what sources the politicians referenced.
      
"Categorization" tag marks when the speaker assigns an individual to a group. We identified both the target of categorization, and the group to which they were assigned.
      
"Consensus Building" tag marks when the speaker identifies with a group, usually to curry political favor. 
      
"Disclaimer" tag marks when the speaker presents an idea as positive, only to reject it later.
      
"Evidence" tag marks when the speaker uses supposed evidence to prove a point. We marked whether the evidence was true, false, or unknown.
      
"Hyperbole" tag marks when the speaker exaggerates meaning by making questionable or absurd assumptions.
      
"Implication" tag marks when the speaker infers implicit information in making his/her argument.
      
"Irony" tag marks when the speaker says one thing but means something else, usually using sarcasm.
     
"National Self-Glorification" tag marks when the speaker tries to represent him/herself in a positive light by glorifying Russia.
      
"Statistics" tag marks when the speaker uses numbers to boost credibility. These figures may be either true or false.
      
"Vagueness" tag marks when the speaker blurs the lines between fact and fiction.
   

Several techniques such as "actor description", "consensus", "national self glorification", "polarization", and "victimization" are examples
of manipulative tactics to rally support and create an "us" versus "them" scenario.  Techniques such as "anecdote", "evidentiality", 
"number game", and "conclusion" are examples of a concrete and quantitative attempt to gain support.  Other techniques such as "authority", 
"hyperbole", "irony", and "vagueness" indicate an abstract approach towards gathering support.  

The occurence of these tactics throughout their discourse indicates the types of strategies that Russian politicians employ to gain favor
among their fellow party members and voters.  The results of the election may shed light on which of these tactics yields the greatest 
success.
