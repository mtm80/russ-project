Methodology

To build our analysis, we are applying an assortment of rhetorical tags to the discourse files of the candidates.  These tags account for the 
rhetorical techniques that the candidates use during their interviews and and speeches.  The following is a list of the specific tags
that we are tracking.

Actor description: <actorDesc> The way we describe actors or members of a particular society either in a negative or positive way.
Authority: <ru:authority> Mentioning authorities to support one's claims.
Anecdote: <ru:anecdote> Telling a story to make a point
Categorization: <ru:cat> Assigning people to different groups.
Consensus: <ru:consensus> Creating agreement and solidarity
Disclaimer: <ru:disclaimer> Presenting an idea as something positive and then rejecting it by the use of terms such as 'but' in the second sentence.
Evidentiality: <ru:evidence> Using evidence, true or not, to support one’s ideas. (update schema to represent)
Hyperbole: <ru:hyperbole> A device for enhancing and exaggerating meaning.
Implication: <ru:implication> Deducing or inferring implicit information.
Irony: <ru:irony> Saying something and meaning something else.
Lexicalization: <ru:lex> an overall ideological strategy for negative other-representation through the semantic features of the words.
National Self Glorification: <ru:glory> A device to create positive self representation by glorifying one’s country.
Number Game: <ru:stats> Using numbers and statistics to appear credible.
Promise <ru:promise> The candidate makes a promise or says "we should"
Polarization: <ru:polarization> Categorizing allies as having good attributes and opponents having bad attributes.
Assumption: <ru:assumption> Makes an explicit assumption about something
Vagueness: <ru:vague> Creating uncertainty and ambiguity.
Victimization: <ru:victim> Telling bad stories about enemies
Conclusion <ru:conclusion> Concludes something based on assumptions and evidence posited

Several techniques such as "actor description", "consensus", "national self glorification", "polarization", and "victimization" are examples
of manipulative tactics to rally support and create an "us" versus "them" scenario.  Techniques such as "anecdote", "evidentiality", 
"number game", and "conclusion" are examples of a concrete and quantitative attempt to gain support.  Other techniques such as "authority", 
"hyperbole", "irony", and "vagueness" indicate an abstract approach towards gathering support.  

The occurence of these tactics throughout their discourse indicates the types of strategies that Russian politicians employ to gain favor
among their fellow party members and voters.  The results of the election may shed light on which of these tactics yields the greatest 
success.
