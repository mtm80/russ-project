Welcome to the project webpage for the exploration of
Russian political candidate discourse. 
Our website seeks to explore and analyze an assortment of speeches and
interviews given by several leading Russian presidential candidates during the
2018 presidential election.  

Focus will be placed on the forms of speech that the
candidates employ to identify patterns for linguistic analysis.  Vocabulary, verbs, forms of address and more
are included for analysis.  

 

# About

The Russian 2018 presidential elections are a being held at
an opportune time for this project.  The election
itself is slated for the 18th of March which is well within the
timeline of our project.  Of course, due
to the limitations of the course and available manpower, only a few candidates
can be analyzed.  Among those that were
chosen are Vladimir Putin, Pavel Grudinin, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky.  

The particular texts were selected on the basis of availability rather than the nature of their content.  The quantity of transcribed texts from interviews and speeches is actually rather limited, and since the focus of our work was on honing our skills as digital humanists, we decided not to manually transcribe. Regardless, we intend to draw whatever conclusions that we can from our corpus in the pursuit of our analysis.  We plan to investigate recurring topics in their discourse and how their terminology reflects party ideology, popular attitudes, and how candidates relate to their audiences.   We are using topic modelling to track the subjects that the candidates most frequently cite throughout their discourse.

We chose the three candidates primarily because these three were among the earliest to register as candidates and
also that, by our estimation, they were the leading candidates of the time. They all finished in the top three. For those who may not be familiar with these individuals, see the brief bios below.  

# Election Results

The results were announced on the 19th of March that Putin had won an overwhelming majority of the vote totaling 76%.  He will continue as the president for 6 years until 2024.

Vladimir Zhirinovskii is the leader of the LDPR party(Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) and has run for the presidency five times. He has sought to form an opposition party to the status quo though has had very limited success.  Zhirinovsky is well know for his nationalistic views, outspokenness, and anti-western opinions.  His party advocates a strong economic interventionist policy while still allowing private ownership of property.  The party claims to oppose the communism of the Soviet Union while still advocating the restoration of historical Russian borders which requires the reabsorption of former soviet states such as Belarussia and the Ukraine.

# Project Participants

## Richard Fulop
Richie is a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh studying Computer Science and Russian. On this project, he took the lead on the programming aspect of the project, and wrote a lot of the code that works behind the scenes to help analyse and understand the corpus. After graduation in Fall 2018, Richie plans to pursue a career using both his skills with language and technology.

## Ian Loughney

## Matt Murphy
Matt is also a 4th-year undergraduate who is pursuing a degree in Russian language and minoring in Korean language.  He suggested the topic of Russian political discourse and took the lead on writing the majority of the web content for the pages.  He plans to find a career in foreign intelligence using foreign languages.  

All three of the participants of this project are completinga requirement for their respective majors. Ian Loughney is completing a linguistics major requirement and is focusing on the speech mechanics of the candidates to determine patterns regarding content and levels of formality/speaker attitudes.  The other two, Richard and Matt, are completing a Russian majorcapstone requirement and have a more general approach.  

# Potentially exclude

Beyond the mechanical analysis, which is still important to the completion of the project, the content of the discourse will explore the broader context of the topics that are discussed.  The investigation includes a cultural aspect to reflect the manifestation of politics in Russian society. Regardless, an exploration of the linguisticaspects of the texts will be done for pattern identification and analysis.  For each candidate, three to five speechesand/or interviews were selected for analysis.
