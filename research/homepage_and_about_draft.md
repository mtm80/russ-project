Welcome to the project webpage for the exploration of
Russian political candidate discourse. 
Our website seeks to explore and analyze an assortment of speeches and
interviews given by several leading Russian presidential candidates during the
2018 presidential election.  

Focus will be placed on the forms of speech that the
candidates employ to identify patterns for linguistic analysis.  Vocabulary, verbs, forms of address and more
are included for analysis.  

 

About

The Russian 2018 presidential elections are a being held at
an opportune time for this project.  The election
itself is slated for the 18th of March which is well within the
timeline of our project.  Of course, due
to the limitations of the course and available manpower, only a few candidates
can be analyzed.  Among those that were
chosen are Vladimir Putin, Pavel Grudinin, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky.  

All three of the participants of this project are completing
a requirement for their respective majors. 
One student is completing a linguistics major requirement and is
focusing on the speech mechanics of the candidates.  The other two are completing a Russian major
capstone requirement and have a more general approach.  Regardless, an exploration of the linguistic
aspects of the texts will be done for pattern identification and analysis.  For each candidate, three to five speeches
and/or interviews were selected for analysis.
