Welcome to the project webpage for the exploration of
Russian political candidate discourse. 
Our website seeks to explore and analyze an assortment of speeches and
interviews given by several leading Russian presidential candidates during the
2018 presidential election.  

Focus will be placed on the forms of speech that the
candidates employ to identify patterns for linguistic analysis.  Vocabulary, verbs, forms of address and more
are included for analysis.  

 

About

The Russian 2018 presidential elections are a being held at
an opportune time for this project.  The election
itself is slated for the 18th of March which is well within the
timeline of our project.  Of course, due
to the limitations of the course and available manpower, only a few candidates
can be analyzed.  Among those that were
chosen are Vladimir Putin, Pavel Grudinin, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky.  

All three of the participants of this project are completing
a requirement for their respective majors. 
One student is completing a linguistics major requirement and is
focusing on the speech mechanics of the candidates.  The other two are completing a Russian major
capstone requirement and have a more general approach.  Regardless, an exploration of the linguistic
aspects of the texts will be done for pattern identification and analysis.  For each candidate, three to five speeches
and/or interviews were selected for analysis. 

We chose the three candidates primarily because these three were among the earliest to register as candidates and
also that, by our estimation, they were the leading candidates at the time.  For those who may not be familiar with
these individuals, see the brief bios below.  

Vladimir Putin has had a long career spaning 16 years as a KGB agent and has since retired and entered politics where he has remained ever since.  He served 2 consecutive terms as President of Russian from 2000 to 2008,one term as prime minister from 2008 to 2012, a third term from 2012 to 2018, and has been elected in 2018 for a fourth term.  He has been a member of the Unity and United Russian parties during his political career and pursued a policy of general economic liberalism, formation of economic ties with other eurasian nations such as China, and an adversarial relationship with western governments.  According to Russian-based polls, he enjoys a large approval rate among the population with numbers over 70% often cited.  

Vladimir Zhirinovsky is the leader of the LDPR party(Liberal Democratic Party of Russia) and has run for the presidency five times. He has sought to form an opposition party to the status quo though has had very limited success.  Zhirinovsky is well know for his nationalistic views, outspokenness, and anti-western opinions.  His party advocates a strong economic interventionist policy while still allowing private ownership of property.  The party claims to oppose the communism of the Soviet Union while still advocating the restoration of historical Russian borders which requires the reabsorption of former soviet states such as Belarussia and the Ukraine.  

Pavel Grudinin is a politician and entrepreneur who was the Communist Party's presidential candidate in 2018.  He worked at the Lenin State Farm as a mechanic and later formed a private company called ZAO Lenin State Farm.  He has since served three terms as a deputy of the Moscow Oblast Duma.  The policy of his party is the restoration of socialism with marxism and leninism as the guiding ideologies.
