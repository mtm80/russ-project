Welcome to the project webpage for the exploration of
Russian political candidate discourse. 
Our website seeks to explore and analyze an assortment of speeches and
interviews given by several leading Russian presidential candidates during the
2018 presidential election.  

Focus will be placed on the forms of speech that the
candidates employ to identify patterns for linguistic analysis.  Vocabulary, verbs, forms of address and more
are included for analysis.

Topic 

The motivation behind the selection of this topic is three-fold.  First, we sought a topic that would be more unusual than another survey of literary questions and political discourse is among the less explored realms of the digital humanities.  Second, although all three of us are specializing in Russian language, Russian politics are still relatively unfamiliar to us so there is a genuine opportunity to gain insight into the inner workings of Russian government.  Finally, after all of the excitement of the American presidential election and allegations of Russian involvement in 2016, we were curious to uncover any possible impacts on Russian politics.  

Given our relative lack of familiarity with Russian government, we are taking an general approach to our investigation.  We selected three leading candidates to form the basis of our research and we analyze their discourse.  We intend to investigate which topics are of greatest concern to the Russian public, how the candidates address those topics, and how they propose to resolve those concerns.  We are not attempting to prove a hypothesis.  Instead, we are conducting purely exploratory research and plan to report any findings of particular interest.

The Russian 2018 presidential elections were being held at
an opportune time for this project.  The election
itself was slated for the 18th of March which is well within the
timeline of our project.  Of course, due
to the limitations of the course and available manpower, only three candidates
can be analyzed.  Among those that were
chosen are Vladimir Putin, Pavel Grudinin, and Vladimir Zhirinovskii.

The particular texts were selected on the basis of availability rather than the nature of their content.  The quantity of transcribed texts from interviews and speeches is actually rather limited, and since the focus of our work was on honing our skills as digital humanists, we decided not to manually transcribe. Regardless, we intend to draw whatever conclusions that we can from our corpus in the pursuit of our analysis.  We plan to investigate recurring topics in their discourse and how their terminology reflects party ideology, popular attitudes, and how candidates relate to their audiences.   We are using topic modelling to track the subjects that the candidates most frequently cite throughout their discourse.

We employ rhetorical marking as an analytical tool to track discourse patterns among the candidates.  These markers do not keep track of topics but rather highlight rhetorical strategies that the candidates use to influence their audiences.  For example, we can use markers such as <ru:hyperbole> or <ru:stats> to demonstrate how the candidates prefer to engage an audience.  Use of hyperbole suggests an emotive approach to discourse and the use of statistics suggests that a candidate prefers a concrete means to sway an audience.  Although we are only tracking three candidates from the 2018 election, their speech patterns will offer insight into Russian rhetorical strategies and patterns.  

We chose the three candidates primarily because these three were among the earliest to register as candidates and
also that, by our estimation, they were the leading candidates of the time. They all finished in the top three. For those who may not be familiar with these individuals, see the brief bios below.  

# Election Results

The results were announced on the 19th of March that Putin had won an overwhelming majority of the vote totaling 76%.  Grudinin received 11% of the vote.  Zhirinovskii received 5% of the vote.  Putin will continue as the president for 6 years until 2024.

He has sought to form an opposition party to the status quo though has had very limited success.  Zhirinovskii is well know for his nationalistic views, outspokenness, and anti-western opinions.  His party advocates a strong economic interventionist policy while still allowing private ownership of property.  The party claims to oppose the communism of the Soviet Union while still advocating the restoration of historical Russian borders which requires the reabsorption of former soviet states such as Belarussia and the Ukraine.
