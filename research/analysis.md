Premise
The goal of the research was exploratory in nature and the use of topic modeling 
is a suitably open-ended means to that end.  The results yielded a mixture of word 
lists that compile the most commonly spoken words from the least to the greatest with
an individual total for each word.  The lists are divided into several categories to 
include the economy, diplomacy, election interference, Syria, and quality of life.  

Limitations
It is essential to note the limited source material and its impact on the results and
analysis.  Due to the limitations of time and manpower, a total of 5 Putin texts and 3
Zhirinovskii texts were chosen.  A small sample such as this should not be taken as 
broadly representative of Russian political discourse or even of the two candidates 
themselves.  Politicians adapt to the contemporary political climate and address topics
that suit the preferences of their audiences.  Their topics and tactics may very well 
change significantly in six months.  Also, the topic modeling was run several times with 
modified parameters each time.  Each of these tests yielded significantly different results.
The precise meaning of any given set of results should be regarded

Results
The percentages that indicate relevancy of particular topics to either candidate are
very close and only on the topic of Syria is there a notable contrast with Zhirinivskii
above Putin by about 8 perent.  The greatest attention was paid to quality of life and Syria 
and both topics were far ahead of the rest.  That the candidates would discuss Syria more 
than most other topics is not surprising given the prominence of warfare in the country and
foreign military involvement.  Russia's military involvement and its rivalry with the United 
States are a significant topic in politics as is the case in the US.  Quality of life was not
expected to be among the most addressed.  Although this could be a result of the limited 
sample size, this may indicate a general concern among voters about a declining living
standard.
