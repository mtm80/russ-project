**Analysis of _SHIFTING PERSPECTIVES: A Study of US Print Media Perceptions of the Russo-Chechen Conflict Before and After September 11, 2001_**

The main focus of this paper was to research the frame of reference through which a few major US papers looked at the Chechnya conflict after 9/11. In particular, they looked at how "attached" or emotional the coverage was (humanization of victims, for example), whether the Chechens are called "terrorists" or "separtists", and balance of points-of-view. In general, these are not attributes we're looking to analyse.
