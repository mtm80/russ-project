<h2>Zhirinovsky and LDPR</h2>

<p>
        As stated in the
        <a href="https://ldpr.ru/party/Program_LDPR/">party program</a> and reinforced by much of Zhirinovskii's rhetoric both in our corpus, and in quotations throughout
        his career, the LDPR is interested in security and social stability above all else. The party, if they are successful
        in elections, promises to rapidly expand the military-industrial base in order to achieve full employment and quick
        economic growth.

        Zhirinovskii is also widely considered to be a populist, Russian nationalist, and strong supporter of the Orthodox Church.
        At times, he has proposed radical measures like building a border wall on the Caucasus to keep out Muslims.

        He has also made brash comments threatening to carpet bomb Poland and the Baltic countries.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ybOSdts-fRw?t=57s">[source]</a> 
        Much like other populist politicians, he has an authoritarian streak, making proposals to 
        re-institute autocracy and adopt Imperial Russian symbols.

<h2>Putin and Edinaja Rossija</h2>

<p>
        The Ediniaja Rossija <a href="https://er.ru/party/program/">party</a> platform sums up Putin's goals and interests best. 
        Mataintaining national unity and independence, and ensuring stability are first and 
        foremost in Putin's rhetoric. Even today, Putin's rhetoric reminds the Russian people 
        of the economic chaos during the 1990's, and implicitly reminds them of his 
        success in stabilizing and bringing prestige back to the country. In doing so, he reminds us 
        that economic conditions are still very difficult, but in these conditions he has been able 
        to guarantee some growth (&lt;1% GDP growth per year). In foreign policy, Putin 
        ignores the actions he's taken to worsen relations with the West, rather saying that 
        he's open to cooperation (for example, in Syria), but the West refuses.
</p>
<p>
        Rhetorically, Putin has been described as blending elements of populism and scripted 
        propaganda to defend his rule. Rather than engage with conspiracy theories himself, he 
        alludes to them. (could reference example in French text) Often, he uses anecdotes or 
        evidence that is inherently unverifiable to bolster his arguments. In cases where he 
        might feel trapped by an interviewer, he will draw a false equivalence between the West 
        and Russia. (reference example)
